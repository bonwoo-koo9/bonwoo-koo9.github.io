Hi, I'm a South Korean student who has grown up in Korea and Mexico. As a senior in [the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://ise.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, I've been doing research in the [Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by [Prof.Chanyoung Park](https://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/)

For the past two years of undergraduate research, I have worked on Explainable Deep Clustering in finance and LLM-based Recommender Systems in e-commerce. 

My research interest lies in Safe and Explainable AI, particulary in the fields of social welfare such as healthcare, finance, and education. Currently, I'm focused on Explainable Deep Learning and Large Language Models to leverage AI for the betterment of society. Going on, I aim to utilize AI to address issues in healthcare, especially in Mental Health and Brain Health. 
* Data-driven Deep Learning
* Trustworthy Large Language Model
* Multi-modal Recommender Systems
* Machine Learning in Mental Health and Brain Health (Coming Soon)
