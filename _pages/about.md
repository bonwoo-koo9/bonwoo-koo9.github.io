Hi, I'm a South Korean student who has grown up in Korea and Mexico. I am a senior in [the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://ise.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, and I am currently in the exchange program at Georgia Institute of Technology. I've started a new research in the [ViTAL Lab](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/) at [GeorgiaTech X Emory Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/) advised by [Prof.Hyeokhyen Kwon](https://kwonvitallab.github.io/members/hyeok-kwon.html).

For the past two years of undergraduate research, I have worked on <a href="{{ '/portfolio/#portfolio1' | relative_url }}">Explainable Deep Clustering in finance</a> and <a href="{{ '/portfolio/#portfolio2' | relative_url }}">LLM-based Recommender Systems in e-commerce</a>. 

My research interest lies in Safe and Explainable AI, particulary in the fields of social welfare such as healthcare, finance, and education. Currently, I'm focused on XAI and Multi-modal AI to leverage AI for the betterment of society. I aim to utilize AI to address issues in healthcare, especially in Mental Health and Brain Health.
