title: "Explainable Deep Clustering for Financial Customer Profiling"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/FE Research Vis.png' style='width: 800px; height: auto;'><br/><br/>

Starting as a project for BigData Competition in NH Investment & Securities with the topic of Advanced Customer Profiling and Personalized Investment Portfolio Curation, I extended our project with teammates into an academic research initiative using high-dimensional cross-sectional data from Korea Institute of Public Finance. <br/><br/>

Effective customer segmentation and communication of these findings to non-experts is a pressing task in the 
financial services sector, with the potential for widespread applications. This study employs a three-stage 
dimension reduction and clustering technique to segment a large, high-dimensional dataset, emphasizing 
explainability and intuitive visualization. We present the high-dimensional data and feature set using novel 
network-based visualization methods and identify the multi-stage processâ€™s optimal configuration. Finally, we derive investment portfolios for each segment to demonstrate an expert system application in financial investment advisory to underscore the importance of explainable segmentations. <br/><br/>

This paper has been accepted at [EAAI Vol 128](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197623015622?via%3Dihub). Using these findings, I also presented a [poster](../files/2023_IE_Frontier_Poster_BONWOO_KOO.pdf) in IE Frontier, an internal research poster competition in KAIST ISE Department. Also, I have applied this framework to cluster financial securities including stock, and wrote a paper on Stock Deep Clustering and its application to Fama-French Factor Model."
